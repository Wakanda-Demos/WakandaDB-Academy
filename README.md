A Wakanda Server learning platform with server-side JavaScript execution sandbox

**This WAK6 branch is the ongoing version to replace the WAK5 version
in production on http://play.wakanda.org it has been updated to run with Wakanda 6**

## Getting Started ##

###1. Admin user###
The default *'admin'* user has for password *'admin'*

**You must personalize it before putting a version in production**

###2. Launch the project###

The main Web page will provide you a short presentation followed by a Server-SideÂ JavaScript console to play with.

Some code examples are proposed to discover the API of the WakandaDB NoSQL engine.

###3. Fake data###
The project include a fakeData generator module.
A tool script can be used to generate the amount of fake employees you want. **It is called by default on startup of the project by the "initApp" shared worker and creates approximatively 20,000 employees if no data exist in the database**.

To create 1 million, more or less fake data you can:

1. Goto the 'Tools' folder of the *'WakandaDB-Academy'* project
2. Open *'createFakeData.js'*
3. Set the *'COUNT_EMPLOYEES_TO_CREATE'* value
4. Run the script
